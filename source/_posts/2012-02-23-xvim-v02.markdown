Well, [xVim] v0.2 is out. It now supports __Visual Mode__, _though some command are still not implemented yet_.

<!-- more -->

# What is xVim
xVim is a [SIMBL] plugin which aims to provide __[Vim] Key-Binding__ for __NSTextView__. So every cocoa app which uses NSTextView can have vim key binding with them. Sounds like crazy, huh?

# What is not xVim
Any way, the difference between [Vim] and [xVim] is that, [Vim] is an full featured (not-good-looking?) editor, while xVim is just a plugin.  
That is to say, features belonged to editor (e.g. bookmarks, tags, and anything sounds complicated...=, =) will not be implemented in xVim.

# What app is supported
Well:

-   __[Xcode]__ (I'm using 4.2, and I bet other versions will works fine)
-   [Chocolat]
-   [Espresso]
-   And anything that has __NSTextView__ within it.
