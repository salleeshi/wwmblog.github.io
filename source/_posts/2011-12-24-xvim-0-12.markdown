So [xVim] has updated to 0.12. 

Fixed some bugs
Added a little more key binding like (ctrl+u and ctrl+d).
Added a simplified key-mapping feature, so that you can type 'jk' or other stuff in insert mode to switch back to normal mode.
some motions, % and visual mode are still not implemented.

BTW, xVim is a SIMBL plugin to add vim like key-binding to Xcode and other application that uses NSTextView.

Check it out in [github repo](https://github.com/WarWithinMe/xVim)

Currently supported are Xcode, espresso and chocalat.

(TextMate does not use NSTextView, so if someone wants to use vim in TextMate, they should use Vico app.)
